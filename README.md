# TIS-Assignment-4

Newsletter for Industrial Visit 2

What the assignment was about

This assignment was based on an industrial visit to Johor Port, Pasir Gudang, documented in the form of a newsletter. It highlights the technologies used in port operations, including digital business applications, high-availability infrastructure, cybersecurity measures, and data-driven decision-making systems.

What I learned / gained

From this industrial visit, I learned how modern ICT infrastructure supports large-scale maritime and logistics operations. I gained insight into systems such as JPBI e-Community, Port Access Management System (PAMS), ERP applications, and how private 4G LTE connectivity and fiber optic networks ensure smooth and uninterrupted port operations.

Skills developed

-Industry awareness – understanding real-world ICT implementation in logistics

-Technical knowledge – exposure to cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity, and disaster recovery systems

-Data literacy – learning how tools like Python and Power BI support data-driven decisions

-Communication skills – presenting technical information in a newsletter format

Problems faced

One challenge was understanding complex technical concepts such as the ‘active-active’ data center redundancy and cybersecurity operations. Another difficulty was summarizing detailed industrial information into a concise and reader-friendly newsletter.

Suggestions for improvement

The visit could be improved by providing live demonstrations of the systems used in port operations. Additional hands-on exposure or walkthroughs of the monitoring systems would further enhance students’ understanding of real-time industrial ICT environments.
